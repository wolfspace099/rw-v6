## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this website

**rw-v6** is the sixth iteration of the robotics website, this time completely changed for the next era of this club. 
Next school years we will be trying to expand our community, to become a loved club at school, even for the haters.
This site is written by 2 club members, more about them on the site itself (me too ofc).
The backend dev for this site is <a href="https://github.com/NathanSchalkwijk">@NathanSchalkwijk</a>, he worked on the login, registering, router.php etc. 
We have worked on many other sites before, tried React (found it meh), website builders (not really website "building") and much more, until we decided to go for plain old buddy HTML.
I made the frontend first, and then handed it off to <a href="https://github.com/NathanSchalkwijk">@NathanSchalkwijk</a> to work on the backend, he was also the one who decided to use PHP.
But why, well thats because:

- Less buggy, hosting anywhere, including local in the code editor.
- HTML is really easy
- No building or deploying, just hosting.
- CSS and JS with HTML can be in just a .HTML file.
- PHP works well for databases, hosting and navigation.

## üîß How does the website work. How is it built?

So for this one we added a "Robotica Lid" dashboard. 
It allows users who become members to experience something special with they're own dashboard, accessing the docs, newest newsletters and scheduling there visits to the club.
How the website actually works is different.

* HTML, JS and CSS stack
* Added PHP for better backend on login etc.
* Run using PHP
* Hosted on Printiacs Hosting, with their attack protection and custom built proxy system.
 ------
* To host it yourself,
* make sure your have a sessions folder in the root directory of the site
* run the site using "php -S <host>:<port> router.php" eg. php -S 0.0.0.0:5000 router.php
* the router.php is used for the site's navigation, it's not essential but it makes the URLs look nicer because it allows for the .php file extension to not be in the requested URL.
* router.php also makes the 404.php and 403.php work, so if you want those you need it.
