## ℹ️ About this website

**rw-v6** is the sixth iteration of the robotics website, this time completely changed for the next era of this club. Next school years we will be trying to expand our community, to become a loved club at school, even for the haters.

---

## 🔧 How does the website work. How is it build?

So for this one we added a "Robotica Lid" dashboard, that allows users who become members to experience something special with they're own dashboard, accessing the docs, newest newsletters and scheduling there visits to the club.
How the website actually works is different.

* HTML, JS and CSS stack
* Added PHP for better backend on login etc.
* Run using PHP
* Hosted at our own server, routed via custom proxy.
